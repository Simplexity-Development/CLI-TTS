# Command Line TTS
I will keep on accidentally referring to it as CLI TTS - so I just named the repo that to get it out of the way

Todo:

- [ ] Make closing tags less annoying
- [ ] Manage exceptions better
- [ ] Probably unify the config into one file
- [ ] Add configuration for audio output destination
